## 04-01: Application Header Navigation

Implemented a fixed application header with navigation controls and dynamic routing structure to provide consistent user interface navigation across the chat application.

**Key Features:**

- **Fixed Header Layout**: Created `AppHeader.vue` component with fixed positioning (`position: fixed`) to remain visible across all pages with proper z-index layering
- **Dynamic Title Display**: Integrated `useAppConfig()` to display application title (`Nuxt Chat`) centrally in the header for brand consistency
- **Route Structure Migration**: Migrated from single `/chat` route to dynamic `/chats/[id].vue` structure for scalable multi-chat functionality

## 04-02: Global State Management with useState

Implemented centralized chat management using Nuxt's `useState` composable for cross-component state sharing and persistent data management across the application lifecycle.

**Key Features:**

- **Global State Initialization**: Created `useChats()` composable employing `useState<Chat[]>('chats', () => [MOCK_CHAT])` for server-side compatible state management
- **Composable Architecture**: Established reusable `useChat(chatId)` pattern accepting dynamic parameters for granular chat access

## 04-03: Project Management and Chat Organization

Implemented project management functionality with comprehensive chat-project relationships.

**Key Features:**

- **Project Management Composables**: Created `useProjects()` composable for global project state management using `useState<Project[]>('projects', () => [MOCK_PROJECT])` pattern with `createProject()` functionality
- **Individual Project Composables**: Established `useProject(projectId)` composable providing reactive project access with `updateProject()` method for granular project modifications
- **Enhanced Chat Relationships**: Extended `Chat` interface with `projectId`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` fields for comprehensive project-chat associations and temporal tracking
- **Chat-Project Integration**: Added `getChatsByProject(projectId)` method to `useChats()` enabling filtered chat retrieval by project affiliation
- **Dynamic Chat Creation**: Enhanced `createChat()` function with optional `projectId` parameter for seamless project assignment during chat initialization

## 04-04: Navigation and Route Protection

Implemented seamless navigation flow with automatic routing after chat creation and added route protection for invalid chat IDs to enhance user experience and application reliability.

**Key Features:**

- **Integrated Navigation Flow**: Created `createChatAndNavigate()` method in `useChats()` composable that combines chat creation with automatic navigation to the new chat route using `navigateTo()`
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Updated `AppHeader.vue` and `index.vue` to use the new navigation-integrated method, eliminating manual navigation steps for users
- **Route Protection**: Added chat validation in `/chats/[id].vue` with automatic redirect to home page when accessing non-existent chat IDs using `navigateTo('/', { replace: true })`
- **TypeScript Interface Optimization**: Introduced `CreateChatOptions` interface with default options pattern for better type safety and code maintainability

## 04-05: Collapsible Sidebar Navigation

Implemented a responsive sidebar navigation system with toggle functionality and chat list display to enhance application navigation and provide better user experience on different screen sizes.

**Key Features:**

- **Collapsible Sidebar Component**: Created `AppSidebar.vue` with responsive design using Tailwind CSS transforms and transitions for smooth show/hide animations
- **State Management Integration**: Integrated sidebar with global chat state using `useChats()` composable for real-time chat list display with proper TypeScript prop definitions
- **Toggle Functionality**: Enhanced `AppHeader.vue` with emit-based communication pattern using `defineEmits(['toggleSidebar'])` for parent-child component interaction
- **Layout Responsive Design**: Updated `default.vue` layout with reactive sidebar state management using `ref(true)` and conditional main content margin adjustments
- **Visual State Indicators**: Implemented active route highlighting using NuxtLink's `active-class` property with proper CSS variable integration for consistent theming
- **Smooth Animations**: Added CSS transitions with `duration-300` for sidebar toggle and `duration-200` for hover states to enhance user interaction feedback

**Code Improvements:**

- use NuxtUI4 Drawer component
