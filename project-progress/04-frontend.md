## 04-01: Application Header Navigation

Implemented a fixed application header with navigation controls and dynamic routing structure to provide consistent user interface navigation across the chat application.

**Key Features:**

- **Fixed Header Layout**: Created `AppHeader.vue` component with fixed positioning (`position: fixed`) to remain visible across all pages with proper z-index layering
- **Dynamic Title Display**: Integrated `useAppConfig()` to display application title (`Nuxt Chat`) centrally in the header for brand consistency
- **Route Structure Migration**: Migrated from single `/chat` route to dynamic `/chats/[id].vue` structure for scalable multi-chat functionality

## 04-02: Global State Management with useState

Implemented centralized chat management using Nuxt's `useState` composable for cross-component state sharing and persistent data management across the application lifecycle.

**Key Features:**

- **Global State Initialization**: Created `useChats()` composable employing `useState<Chat[]>('chats', () => [MOCK_CHAT])` for server-side compatible state management
- **Composable Architecture**: Established reusable `useChat(chatId)` pattern accepting dynamic parameters for granular chat access
