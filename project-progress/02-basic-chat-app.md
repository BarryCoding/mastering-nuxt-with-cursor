## 02-01: NuxtPage and simple routing

Implemented Nuxt's file-based routing system with `NuxtPage` component and created basic chat application structure.

**Key Features:**

- **File-based routing**: Nuxt automatically creates routes based on files in the `pages/` directory
- **NuxtPage component**: Renders the current page component based on the route
- **NuxtRouteAnnouncer**: Provides accessibility announcements for route changes
- **Navigation**: `UButton` with `to` prop for client-side navigation
