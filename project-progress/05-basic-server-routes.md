## 05-01: Shared Folder and Auto-Import

### Summary

Refactored the chat layer to implement Nuxt 4's shared folder structure, moving type definitions and utility functions from app-specific locations to a centralized `shared/` directory. This change leverages Nuxt 4's auto-import capabilities to eliminate manual import statements across components and composables.

### Key Changes

- **Auto-Import Integration**: Removed manual import statements from components and composables, allowing Nuxt 4's auto-import system to handle type resolution automatically
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to `ChatMessage` interface for better data consistency

## 05-02: Repository Pattern

### Summary

Implemented the Repository pattern for data access layer, creating dedicated repository modules for `Chat` and `Project` entities. This architectural pattern provides a clean separation between data access logic and business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and testable while establishing a foundation for future database integration.

### Key Changes

- **Chat Repository**: Created `chat-repository.ts` with comprehensive CRUD operations including chat management, message handling, and project relationship resolution
- **Project Repository**: Implemented `project-repository.ts` with basic project management operations and data persistence
- **Cross-Repository Integration**: Implemented proper dependency injection between repositories for related data fetching

### Repository Pattern Benefits

- **Data Abstraction**: Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repository functions for unit testing
- **Consistency**: Standardized data access patterns across the application
- **Future-Proof**: Simple migration path to database persistence without changing business logic
