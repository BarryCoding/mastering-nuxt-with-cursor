## 05-01: Shared Folder and Auto-Import

### Summary

Refactored the chat layer to implement Nuxt 4's shared folder structure, moving type definitions and utility functions from app-specific locations to a centralized `shared/` directory. This change leverages Nuxt 4's auto-import capabilities to eliminate manual import statements across components and composables.

### Key Changes

- **Auto-Import Integration**: Removed manual import statements from components and composables, allowing Nuxt 4's auto-import system to handle type resolution automatically
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to `ChatMessage` interface for better data consistency
