## 05-01: Shared Folder and Auto-Import

### Summary

Refactored the chat layer to implement Nuxt 4's shared folder structure, moving type definitions and utility functions from app-specific locations to a centralized `shared/` directory. This change leverages Nuxt 4's auto-import capabilities to eliminate manual import statements across components and composables.

### Key Changes

- **Auto-Import Integration**: Removed manual import statements from components and composables, allowing Nuxt 4's auto-import system to handle type resolution automatically
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Added `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to `ChatMessage` interface for better data consistency

## 05-02: Repository Pattern

### Summary

Implemented the Repository pattern for data access layer, creating dedicated repository modules for `Chat` and `Project` entities. This architectural pattern provides a clean separation between data access logic and business logic, making the codebase more maintainable and testable while establishing a foundation for future database integration.

### Key Changes

- **Chat Repository**: Created `chat-repository.ts` with comprehensive CRUD operations including chat management, message handling, and project relationship resolution
- **Project Repository**: Implemented `project-repository.ts` with basic project management operations and data persistence
- **Cross-Repository Integration**: Implemented proper dependency injection between repositories for related data fetching

### Repository Pattern Benefits

- **Data Abstraction**: Clean separation between data access and business logic
- **Testability**: Easy to mock repository functions for unit testing
- **Consistency**: Standardized data access patterns across the application
- **Future-Proof**: Simple migration path to database persistence without changing business logic

## 05-03: Basic Server API Routes

### Summary

Implemented foundational server API routes for the chat system using Nuxt 4's server engine. Created RESTful endpoints following HTTP method conventions with proper separation of concerns between API handlers and repository layer. These routes establish the backend foundation for chat data management while leveraging Nuxt 4's automatic route registration and type-safe server-side execution.

### Key Changes

- **GET `/api/chats`**: Implemented `index.get.ts` to retrieve all chat records through repository abstraction
- **POST `/api/chats`**: Created `index.post.ts` for creating new chat instances with default configuration
- **Repository Integration**: Connected API handlers directly to existing repository functions for clean data access
- **Nuxt 4 Server Engine**: Leveraged `defineEventHandler` for type-safe server-side request handling with automatic route registration

## 05-04: Dynamic Server Routes

### Summary

Implemented dynamic server routes using Nuxt 4's bracket notation for parameterized endpoints. Created a POST route at `/api/chats/[id]/messages/generate` that demonstrates dynamic route parameter extraction, AI service integration, and automated message generation within specific chat contexts.

### Key Changes

- **Dynamic Route Parameters**: Implemented `[id]` bracket notation for chat ID parameter extraction using `getRouterParams(event)`
- **AI Integration**: Connected OpenAI service with runtime configuration for automated message generation
- **Message Generation Flow**: Created end-to-end workflow from chat history retrieval to AI response generation and message creation
- **Error Handling**: Added proper validation for required chat ID parameter with structured error responses

## 05-05: Send Data to Server

### Summary

Enhanced server API routes to accept and process dynamic data from client requests using Nuxt 4's `readBody()` utility.

### Key Changes

- **Dynamic Chat Creation**: Modified `/api/chats` POST endpoint to accept `title` and `projectId` from request body instead of using hardcoded values
- **Message Creation Endpoint**: Implemented `/api/chats/[id]/messages` POST route for adding new messages to specific chats with dynamic content and role handling
- **Request Body Processing**: Integrated `readBody(event)` for extracting JSON payloads from POST requests with proper async handling
- **Parameter Extraction**: Combined `getRouterParams(event)` for dynamic route parameters with `readBody(event)` for request data processing

## 05-06: AI-Powered Chat Title Generation

### Summary

Implemented an AI-powered chat title generation endpoint that automatically creates concise titles for chat conversations based on the first message.

### Key Changes

- **Title Generation Endpoint**: Created `/api/chats/[id]/title` POST route for dynamic chat title updates using AI-generated summaries
- **AI Service Enhancement**: Added `generateChatTitle()` function to AI service with specialized prompt for creating 3-word or less summaries
- **Dynamic Title Updates**: Integrated repository pattern with AI service to seamlessly update chat records with generated titles

## 05-07: Complete REST API

### Summary

Completed the RESTful API implementation by adding comprehensive CRUD operations for both chat and project entities. This final step establishes a complete server-side API layer that supports full data management operations, enabling seamless frontend-backend communication for the chat application.

### Key Changes

- **Chat Data Retrieval**: Implemented `GET /api/chats/[id]` endpoint for fetching individual chat records with dynamic ID parameter extraction
- **Message Retrieval**: Created `GET /api/chats/[id]/messages` endpoint for accessing all messages within a specific chat conversation
- **Project CRUD Operations**: Added complete project management endpoints including `GET /api/projects`, `POST /api/projects`, `GET /api/projects/[id]`, and `PUT /api/projects/[id]`
- **Dynamic Route Parameters**: Utilized `getRouterParams(event)` for consistent parameter extraction across all dynamic routes
- **Repository Integration**: Connected all new endpoints to existing repository functions, maintaining clean separation of concerns
